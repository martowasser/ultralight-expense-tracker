## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npx prisma migrate dev --name <name>` to create and apply migrations
- Prisma client is generated to `src/generated/prisma/` (gitignored)
- PostgreSQL runs in Docker container `expense-tracker-postgres` on port 5434
- Always use `@default()` for new required fields to preserve existing data
- Use `onDelete: SetNull` for optional foreign keys to prevent cascade issues
- Use `onDelete: Cascade` for required relationships (like userId)
- Run `npx prisma generate` after pulling schema changes to regenerate client
- Server actions pattern: use `"use server"` directive, auth check, validate input, return `{ success, error? }`
- Client components: use `"use client"`, useState for modal state, router.refresh() after mutations
- Modal pattern: fixed inset-0 bg-black/30 overlay, items-end sm:items-center for mobile sheet
- Import enums from `@/generated/prisma/enums`, types from actions.ts files

## 2026-01-18 22:25 - US-029
- What was implemented:
  - Added comprehensive Prisma schema with new models for institutions, accounts, credit cards, and user settings
  - Created enums: InstitutionType, Currency, ExpenseCategory, PaymentMethod, CardBrand
  - Created models: Institution, Account, CreditCard, UserSettings, ExpenseTag
  - Enhanced Expense model with new fields: category, currency, paymentMethod, paymentSourceId, paidWithCardId, linkedCreditCardId, isActive
  - Migration preserves existing data with defaults (category=OTHER, currency=ARS)
- Files changed:
  - prisma/schema.prisma (updated with new schema)
  - prisma/migrations/20260119012517_add_comprehensive_expense_schema/migration.sql (new migration)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Docker container `expense-tracker-postgres` needs to be started before running migrations
  - The Prisma client output is in `src/generated/prisma/` and is gitignored
  - All new fields have defaults so existing data is preserved during migrations
  - Use named relations like `@relation("PaymentSourceAccount")` when a model has multiple relations to the same target

## 2026-01-18 22:35 - US-020
- What was implemented:
  - Created /institutions page with full CRUD functionality
  - Institutions grouped by type (Bank, Fintech, Crypto Exchange, Payment Platform)
  - Add/Edit/Delete modals with confirmation for deletion
  - Delete confirmation shows cascade warning (accounts, credit cards that will be deleted)
  - Added navigation links in Header component to switch between expenses and institutions
- Files changed:
  - src/app/institutions/page.tsx (new - server component page)
  - src/app/institutions/actions.ts (new - server actions for CRUD)
  - src/components/InstitutionSection.tsx (new - container with modal state)
  - src/components/InstitutionList.tsx (new - list grouped by type)
  - src/components/AddInstitutionModal.tsx (new - add form modal)
  - src/components/EditInstitutionModal.tsx (new - edit form modal)
  - src/components/DeleteInstitutionModal.tsx (new - delete confirmation with cascade warning)
  - src/components/Header.tsx (updated - added navigation links)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Header now has navigation links for expenses and institutions - add new pages here
  - Use `_count` in Prisma includes to get related entity counts for cascade warnings
  - Group items by category using reduce pattern, then render with ordered keys
  - Keep modal components separate for each action (add/edit/delete) for clarity

## 2026-01-18 22:50 - US-021
- What was implemented:
  - Full account CRUD management within institutions
  - Server actions for create, update, delete accounts (account-actions.ts)
  - AddAccountModal: create account with name and currency (ARS/USD)
  - EditAccountModal: modify account name and currency
  - DeleteAccountModal: confirmation dialog for deletion
  - Accounts displayed under their institution on the institutions page
  - Updated InstitutionList to show "+" account button and account list
  - Updated InstitutionSection to handle all account modals
- Files changed:
  - src/app/institutions/account-actions.ts (new - server actions for accounts)
  - src/app/institutions/actions.ts (updated - include accounts in getInstitutions, export InstitutionAccount type)
  - src/components/AddAccountModal.tsx (new - add account form)
  - src/components/EditAccountModal.tsx (new - edit account form)
  - src/components/DeleteAccountModal.tsx (new - delete confirmation)
  - src/components/InstitutionList.tsx (updated - display accounts under institutions)
  - src/components/InstitutionSection.tsx (updated - handle account modals)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Re-use the same modal pattern for nested entities (accounts under institutions)
  - Pass institutionId and institutionName to AddAccountModal for context
  - Include nested entity data in parent query to avoid additional requests
  - Keep separate action files for clarity (account-actions.ts vs actions.ts)
